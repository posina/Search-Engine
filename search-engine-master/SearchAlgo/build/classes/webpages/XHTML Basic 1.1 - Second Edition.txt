Abstract The XHTML Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be an XHTML host language document type, and in addition it includes images, forms, basic tables, and object support. It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of XHTML features; for example, Web clients such as mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and set top boxes. The document type is rich enough for content authoring. XHTML Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. The goal of XHTML Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents. This revision, 1.1 Second Edition, supercedes version 1.1 as defined in http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xhtml-basic-20080729. In this revision, an XML Schema implementation and the lang attribute have been added. In the update from version 1.0 to version 1.1, several new features were incorporated into the language in order to better serve the small-device community that is this language's major user: XHTML Forms (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) Intrinsic Events (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) The value attribute for the li element (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) The target attribute (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) The style element (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) The style attribute (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) XHTML Presentation module (defined in [XHTMLMOD]) The inputmode attribute (defined in Section 5 of this document) The document type definition is implemented using XHTML modules as defined in "XHTML Modularization" [XHTMLMOD]. Status of this Document This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This document is a W3C Recommendation and supersedes the 29 July 2008 version of the XHTML Basic Recommendation. It reflects cross-industry agreement on a set of markup language features that allows authors to create rich Web content deliverable to a wide range of devices. The only changes in this version are to add an XML Schema implementation of the markup language and integrate the lang attribute to increase compatibility with User Agents and Assistive Technologies. A version that shows the specific changes from the previous Recommendation is available in diff-marked form. This document has been produced by the W3C XHTML2 Working Group as part of the W3C HTML Activity. Please see the Working Group's implementation report.

XHTML for Small Information Appliances HTML 4 is a powerful language for authoring Web content, but its design does not take into consideration issues pertinent to small devices, including the implementation cost (in power, memory, etc.) of the full feature set. Consumer devices with limited resources cannot generally afford to implement the full feature set of HTML 4. Requiring a full-fledged computer for access to the World Wide Web excludes a large portion of the population from consumer device access of online information and services. Because there are many ways to subset HTML, there are many almost identical subsets defined by organizations and companies. Without a common base set of features, developing applications for a wide range of Web clients is difficult. The motivation for XHTML Basic is to provide an XHTML document type that can be shared across communities (e.g. desktop, TV, and mobile phones), and that is rich enough to be used for simple content authoring. New community-wide document types can be defined by extending XHTML Basic in such a way that XHTML Basic documents are in the set of valid documents of the new document type. Thus an XHTML Basic document can be presented on the maximum number of Web clients. The document type definition for XHTML Basic is implemented based on the XHTML modules defined in XHTML Modularization [XHTMLMOD]. For information on best practices for mobile content, we refer you to [MOBILEBP]. 1.2. Background and Requirements Information appliances are targeted for particular uses. They support the features they need for the functions they are designed to fulfill. The following are examples of different information appliances: Mobile phones Televisions PDAs Vending machines Pagers Car navigation systems Mobile game machines Digital book readers Smart watches Existing subsets and variants of HTML for these clients include Compact HTML [CHTML], the Wireless Markup Language [WML], and the "HTML 4.0 Guidelines for Mobile Access" [GUIDELINES]. The common features found in these document types include: Basic text (including headings, paragraphs, and lists) Hyperlinks and links to related documents Basic forms Basic tables Images Meta information This set of HTML features has been the starting point for the design of XHTML Basic. Since many content developers are familiar with these HTML features, they comprise a useful host language that may be combined with markup modules from other languages according to the methods described in "XHTML Modularization" [XHTMLMOD]. For example, XHTML Basic may be extended with a custom module to support richer markup semantics in specific environments. It is not the intention of XHTML Basic to limit the functionality of future languages. But since the features in HTML 4 (frames, advanced tables, etc.) were developed for a desktop computer type of client, they have proved to be inappropriate for many non-desktop devices. XHTML Basic will be extended and built upon. Extending XHTML from a common and basic set of features, instead of almost identical subsets or the too-large set of functions in HTML 4, will be good for interoperability on the Web, as well as for scalability. Compared to the rich functionality of HTML 4, XHTML Basic may look like one step back, but in fact, it is two steps forward for clients that do not need what is in HTML 4 and for content developers who get one XHTML subset instead of many. 1.3. Design Rationale This section explains why certain HTML features are not part of XHTML Basic. 1.3.1. Presentation Many simple Web clients cannot display fonts other than monospace. Bi-directional text, bold faced font, and other text extension elements are not supported. It is recommended that style sheets be used to create a presentation that is appropriate for the device. 1.3.2. Tables Basic XHTML tables ([XHTMLMOD], section 5.6.1) are supported, but tables can be difficult to display on small devices. It is recommended that content developers follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 for creating accessible tables ([WCAG10], Guideline 5). Note that in the Basic Tables Module, nesting of tables is prohibited. 1.3.3. Frames Frames are not supported. Frames depend on a screen interface and may not be applicable to some small appliances like phones, pagers, and watches. 2. Conformance This section is normative. 2.1. Document Conformance A Conforming XHTML Basic document is a document that requires only the facilities described as mandatory in this specification. Such a document must meet all of the following criteria: The document must conform to the constraints expressed in Appendix B and Appendix C . The root element of the document must be . The name of the default namespace on the root element must be the XHTML namespace name, http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml. The start tag MAY also contain the declaration of the XML Schema Instance Namespace and an XML Schema Instance schemaLocation attribute [XMLSCHEMA]. Such an attribute would associate the XHTML namespace http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml with the XML Schema at the URI http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/SCHEMA/xhtml-basic11.xsd. There must be a DOCTYPE declaration in the document prior to the root element. If present, the public identifier included in the DOCTYPE declaration must reference the DTD found in Appendix B using its Formal Public Identifier. The system identifier may be modified appropriately. The DTD subset must not be used to override any parameter entities in the DTD. XHTML Basic 1.1 documents SHOULD be labeled with the Internet Media Type "application/xhtml+xml" as defined in [RFC3236]. For further information on using media types with XHTML, see the informative note [XHTMLMIME]. 2.2. User Agent Conformance The user agent must conform to the "User Agent Conformance" section of the XHTML 1.0 specification ([XHTML1], section 3.2). 3. The XHTML Basic Document Type This section is normative. The XHTML Basic document type is defined as a set of XHTML modules. All XHTML modules are defined in the "XHTML Modularization" specification [XHTMLMOD]. XHTML Basic consists of the following XHTML modules: Structure Module* body, head, html, title Text Module* abbr, acronym, address, blockquote, br, cite, code, dfn, div, em, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, kbd, p, pre, q, samp, span, strong, var Hypertext Module* a List Module* dl, dt, dd, ol, ul, li Forms Module button, fieldset, form, input, label, legend, select, optgroup, option, textarea Basic Tables Module caption, table, td, th, tr Image Module img Object Module object, param Presentation module b, big, hr, i, small, sub, sup, tt Metainformation Module meta Link Module link Base Module base Intrinsic Events module Events attributes Scripting module script and noscript elements Stylesheet module style element Style Attribute Module Deprecated style attribute Target Module target attribute. Note: The target attribute is designed to be a general hook for binding to an external environment (such as Frames, multiple windows, browser-tabbed windows); when there is no such external environment bound to the user agent, the user agent can ignore the target attribute. When there is an external environment bound, the conformance requirements for the target attribute are defined in each environment. The content author needs to be aware that the user agent behavior for the target attribute depends on multiple factors such as the existence of an environment binding, restrictions of available resources, existence of other applications and user preferences (such as pop-up blockers), and implementation-dependent design decisions. When there is no external environmental conformance, it is recommended that authors do not depend on use of the target attribute. It should be noted that any implementation-dependent use of the target attribute might impede interoperability. This specification also adds the lang attribute to the I18N attribute collection as defined in XHTMLMOD. The lang attribute is defined in HTML4. When this attribute and the xml:lang attribute are specified on the same element, the xml:lang attribute takes precedence. When both lang and xml:lang are specified on the same element, they SHOULD have the same value. (*) = This module is a required XHTML Host Language module. XHTML Basic also uses the XHTML inputmode Attribute Module, as defined in this specification. This module adds the inputmode attribute to the input and textarea elements of the XHTML Forms Module. Finally, XHTML Basic adds the value attribute to the li element of the XHTML List Module. An XML 1.0 DTD is available in Appendix B. An XML Schema implementation is available in Appendix C. 4. How to Use XHTML Basic Although XHTML Basic can be used as it is - a simple XHTML language with text, links, and images - the intention of its simple design is for use as a host language. A host language can contain a mix of vocabularies all rolled into one document type. It is natural that XHTML is the host language, since that is what most Web developers are used to. When markup from other languages is added to XHTML Basic, the resulting document type will be an extension of XHTML Basic. Content developers can develop for XHTML Basic or take advantage of the extensions. The goal of XHTML Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of user agents. 5. XHTML inputmode Attribute Module This section is normative. This section was originally a component of XForms 1.0, and was written by Martin Duerst. The inputmode Attribute Module defines the inputmode attribute. inputmode = CDATA This attribute specifies style information for the current element. The following table shows additional attributes for elements defined elsewhere when the inputmode module is selected. Elements Attributes Notes input& inputmode (CDATA) When the Basic Forms or Forms Module is selected. textarea& inputmode (CDATA) When the Basic Forms or Forms Module is selected. The attribute inputmode provides a hint to the user agent to select an appropriate input mode for the text input expected in an associated form control. The input mode may be a keyboard configuration, an input method editor (also called front end processor) or any other setting affecting input on the device(s) used. Using inputmode, the author can give hints to the agent that make form input easier for the user. Authors should provide inputmode attributes wherever possible, making sure that the values used cover a wide range of devices. 5.1 inputmode Attribute Value Syntax The value of the inputmode attribute is a white space separated list of tokens. Tokens are either sequences of alphabetic letters or absolute URIs. The later can be distinguished from the former by noting that absolute URIs contain a ':'. Tokens are case-sensitive. All the tokens consisting of alphabetic letters only are defined in this specification, in 5.3 List of Tokens (or a successor of this specification). This specification does not define any URIs for use as tokens, but allows others to define such URIs for extensibility. This may become necessary for devices with input modes that cannot be covered by the tokens provided here. The URI should dereference to a human-readable description of the input mode associated with the use of the URI as a token. This description should describe the input mode indicated by this token, and whether and how this token modifies other tokens or is modified by other tokens. 5.2 User Agent Behavior Upon entering an empty form control with an inputmode attribute, the user agent should select the input mode indicated by the inputmode attribute value. User agents should not use the inputmode attribute to set the input mode when entering a form control with text already present. To set the appropriate input mode when entering a form control that already contains text, user agents should rely on platform-specific conventions. User agents should make available all the input modes which are supported by the (operating) system/device(s) they run on/have access to, and which are installed for regular use by the user. This is typically only a small subset of the input modes that can be described with the tokens defined here. Note: Additional guidelines for user agent implementation are found at [UAAG 1.0]. The following simple algorithm is used to define how user agents match the values of an inputmode attribute to the input modes they can provide. This algorithm does not have to be implemented directly; user agents just have to behave as if they used it. The algorithm is not designed to produce "obvious" or "desirable" results for every possible combination of tokens, but to produce correct behavior for frequent token combinations and predictable behavior in all cases. First, each of the input modes available is represented by one or more lists of tokens. An input mode may correspond to more than one list of tokens; as an example, on a system set up for a Greek user, both "greek upperCase" and "user upperCase" would correspond to the same input mode. No two lists will be the same. Second, the inputmode attribute is scanned from front to back. For each token t in the inputmode attribute, if in the remaining lists of tokens representing available input modes there is any list of tokens that contains t, then all lists of tokens representing available input modes that do not contain t are removed. If there is no remaining list of tokens that contains t, then t is ignored. Third, if one or more lists of tokens are left, and they all correspond to the same input mode, then this input mode is chosen. If no list is left (meaning that there was none at the start) or if the remaining lists correspond to more than one input mode, then no input mode is chosen. Example: Assume the list of lists of tokens representing the available input modes is: {"cyrillic upperCase", "cyrillic lowerCase", "cyrillic", "latin", "user upperCase", "user lowerCase"}, then the following inputmode values select the following input modes: "cyrillic title" selects "cyrillic", "cyrillic lowerCase" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "lowerCase cyrillic" selects "cyrillic lowerCase", "latin upperCase" selects "latin", but "upperCase latin" does select "cyrillic upperCase" or "user upperCase" if they correspond to the same input mode, and does not select any input mode if "cyrillic upperCase" and "user upperCase" do not correspond to the same input mode. 5.3 List of Tokens Tokens defined in this specification are separated into two categories: Script tokens and modifiers. In inputmode attributes, script tokens should always be listed before modifiers. 5.3.1 Script Tokens Script tokens provide a general indication the set of characters that is covered by an input mode. In most cases, script tokens correspond directly to [Unicode Scripts]. Some tokens correspond to the block names in Java class java.lang.Character.UnicodeBlock ([Java Unicode Blocks]) or Unicode Block names. However, this neither means that an input mode has to allow input for all the characters in the script or block, nor that an input mode is limited to only characters from that specific script. As an example, a "latin" keyboard doesn't cover all the characters in the Latin script, and includes punctuation which is not assigned to the Latin script. The version of the Unicode Standard that these script names are taken from is 3.2. Input Mode Token Comments arabic Unicode script name armenian Unicode script name bengali Unicode script name bopomofo Unicode script name braille used to input braille patterns (not to indicate a braille input device) buhid Unicode script name canadianAboriginal Unicode script name cherokee Unicode script name cyrillic Unicode script name deseret Unicode script name devanagari Unicode script name ethiopic Unicode script name georgian Unicode script name greek Unicode script name gothic Unicode script name gujarati Unicode script name gurmukhi Unicode script name han Unicode script name hangul Unicode script name hanja Subset of 'han' used in writing Korean hanunoo Unicode script name hebrew Unicode script name hiragana Unicode script name (may include other Japanese scripts produced by conversion from hiragana) ipa International Phonetic Alphabet kanji Subset of 'han' used in writing Japanese kannada Unicode script name katakana Unicode script name (full-width, not half-width) khmer Unicode script name lao Unicode script name latin Unicode script name malayalam Unicode script name math mathematical symbols and related characters mongolian Unicode script name myanmar Unicode script name ogham Unicode script name oldItalic Unico de script name oriya Unicode script name runic Unicode script name simplifiedHanzi Subset of 'han' used in writing Simplified Chinese sinhala Unicode script name syriac Unicode script name tagalog Unicode script name tagbanwa Unicode script name tamil Unicode script name telugu Unicode script name thaana Unicode script name thai Unicode script name tibetan Unicode script name traditionalHanzi Subset of 'han' used in writing Traditional Chinese user Special value denoting the 'native' input of the user (e.g. to input her name or text in her native language). yi Unicode script name 5.3.2 Modifier Tokens Modifier tokens can be added to the scripts they apply in order to more closely specify the kind of characters expected in the form control. Traditional PC keyboards do not need most modifier tokens (indeed, users on such devices would be quite confused if the software decided to change case on its own; CAPS lock for upperCase may be an exception). However, modifier tokens can be very helpful to set input modes for small devices. Input Mode Token Comments lowerCase lowercase (for bicameral scripts) upperCase uppercase (for bicameral scripts) titleCase title case (for bicameral scripts): words start with an upper case letter startUpper start input with one uppercase letter, then continue with lowercase letters digits digits of a particular script (e.g. inputmode='thai digits') symbols symbols, punctuation (suitable for a particular script) predictOn text prediction switched on (e.g. for running text) predictOff text prediction switched off (e.g. for passwords) halfWidth half-width compatibility forms (e.g. Katakana; deprecated) 5.4 Relationship to XML Schema pattern facets User agents may use information available in an XML Schema pattern facet to set the input mode. Note that a pattern facet is a hard restriction on the lexical value of an instance data node, and can specify different restrictions for different parts of the data item. Attribute inputmode is a soft hint about the kinds of characters that the user may most probably start to input into the form control. Attribute inputmode is provided in addition to pattern facets for the following reasons: The set of allowable characters specified in a pattern may be so wide that it is not possible to deduce a reasonable input mode setting. Nevertheless, there frequently is a kind of characters that will be input by the user with high probability. In such a case, inputmode allows to set the input mode for the user's convenience. In some cases, it would be possible to derive the input mode setting from the pattern because the set of characters allowed in the pattern closely corresponds to a set of characters covered by an inputmode attribute value. However, such a derivation would require a lot of data and calculations on the user agent. Small devices may leave the checking of patterns to the server, but will easily be able to switch to those input modes that they support. Being able to make data entry for the user easier is of particular importance on small devices. 5.5 Examples This is an example of a form for Japanese address input.

XHTML Basic Customizations An XHTML Family Document Type (such as XHTML Basic) must define the content model that it uses. This is done through a separate content model module that is instantiated by the XHTML Modular Framework. The content model module and the XHTML Basic Driver (above) work together to customize the module implementations to the document type's specific requirements. The content model module for XHTML Basic is defined below: You can download this version of this file from http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xhtml-basic-20101123/xhtml-basic11-model-1.mod.

XHTML Basic Customizations An XHTML Family Document Type (such as XHTML Basic) must define the content model that it uses. This is done through a separate content model module that is instantiated by the XHTML Modular Framework. The content model module and the XHTML Basic Driver (above) work together to customize the module implementations to the document type's specific requirements. The content model module for XHTML Basic is defined below: This is the XML Schema module of named XHTML content models for XHTML Basic 10 $Id: index.html,v 1.2 2010/11/24 21:47:40 bertails Exp $ XHTML Basic 1.1 Document Model This module describes the groupings of elements/attributes that make up common content models for XHTML elements. XHTML has following basic content models: xhtml.Inline.mix; character-level elements xhtml.Block.mix; block-like elements, e.g., paragraphs and lists xhtml.Flow.mix; any block or inline elements xhtml.HeadOpts.mix; Head Elements xhtml.InlinePre.mix; Special class for pre content model xhtml.InlineNoAnchor.mix; Content model for Anchor Any groups declared in this module may be used to create element content models, but the above are considered 'global' (insofar as that term applies here). XHTML has the following Attribute Groups xhtml.Core.extra.attrib xhtml.I18n.extra.attrib xhtml.Common.extra The above attribute Groups are considered Global Extended I18n attribute Extended Common Attributes "style" attribute from Inline Style Module Attributes from Events Module Extend Core Attributes Extended Global Core Attributes Extended Global I18n attributes Extended Global Common Attributes
